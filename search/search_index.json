Also be noticed that there's pyproject.toml in this folder. This is the main configuration file of our project. Step 3: Build a virtual environment for your development \u00b6 Now build a virtual python environment for your development, and develop your project always in that environment from now on. You can choose either annaconda or virtualenv. I prefer annaconda (actually miniconda) though. 1 2 conda create -n mypackage python=3.8 conda activate mypackage You could choose your favorite python version here. Step 4: Install Dev Requirements \u00b6 You should still be in the folder named as %proejct_slug , which containing the pyproject.toml file. Install the new project's local development requirements inside a virtual environment: 1 2 3 pip install poetry poetry install -E doc -E dev -E test tox We start with install poetry, since the whole project is managed by poetry. Then we installed extra dependency need by developer, such as documentation build tools, lint, formatting and test tools etc. We also launch a smoke test here by running tox . This will give you a test report and lint report. You should see no errors except some lint warnings. Tips Extra dependencies are grouped into three groups, doc, dev and test for better granularity. When you ship the package, dependencies in group doc, dev and test might not be shipped. As the developer, you will need install all the dependencies. Tips if you found erros like the following during tox run: 1 ERROR: InterpreterNotFound: python3.9 don't be panic, this is just because python3.x is not found on your machine. If you decide to support that version of Python in your package, please install it on your machine. Otherwise, remove it from tox.ini and pyproject.toml (search python3.x then remove it). Step 5: Create a GitHub Repo \u00b6 Go to your GitHub account and create a new repo named mypackage , where mypackage matches the [project_slug] from your answers to running cookiecutter. Then goto repo > settings > secrets, click on 'New repository secret', add the following secrets: TEST_PYPI_API_TOKEN, see How to apply testpypi token PYPI_API_TOKEN, see How to apply pypi token PERSONAL_TOKEN, see How to apply personal token Step 6: Set Up codecov integration \u00b6 Tips If you have already setup codecov integration and configured access for all your repositories, you can skip this step. In your browser, visit install codecov app , you'll be landed at this page: Click on the green install button at top right, choose all repositories then click on install button, following directions until all set. Step 7: Upload code to github \u00b6 Back to your develop environment, find the folder named after the [project_slug] . Move into this folder, and then setup git to use your GitHub repo and upload the code: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 cd mypackage git add . git commit -m \"Initial skeleton.\" git branch -M main git remote add origin git@github.com:myusername/mypackage.git git push -u origin main Where myusername and mypackage are adjusted for your username and package name. You'll need a ssh key to push the repo. You can Generate a key or Add an existing one. Warning if you answered 'yes' to the question if install pre-commit hooks at last step, then you should find pre-commit be invoked when you run git commit , and some files may be modified by hooks. If so, please add these files and commit again . Check result \u00b6 After pushing your code to github, goto github web page, navigate to your repo, then click on actions link, you should find screen like this: There should be one workflow running. After it finished, go to [testpyi], check if a new artifact is published under the name {{ cookiecutter.project_slug }} Step 8. Check documentation \u00b6 Documentation will be published and available at https://{your_github_account}.github.io/{your_repo} once: 1 2 3 1. the branch is release 2. the commit is tagged, and the tag name is started with 'v' (lower case) 3. build/testing executed by github CI passed If you'd like to see what it's look like now, you could run the followng command: 1 mkdocs gh-deploy then check your documentation at https://{your_github_account}.github.io/{your_repo} Step 9. Make official release \u00b6 After done with your phased development, switch to releas branch, following instructions at release checklist , trigger first official release and check result at PYPI .","title":"Tutorial"},{"location":"tutorial/#tutorial","text":"Note Did you find this article confusing?

This will give you a test report and lint report. You should see no errors except some lint warnings. Tips Extra dependencies are grouped into three groups, doc, dev and test for better granularity. When you ship the package, dependencies in group doc, dev and test might not be shipped. As the developer, you will need install all the dependencies. Tips if you found erros like the following during tox run: 1 ERROR: InterpreterNotFound: python3.9 don't be panic, this is just because python3.x is not found on your machine. If you decide to support that version of Python in your package, please install it on your machine. Otherwise, remove it from tox.ini and pyproject.toml (search python3.x then remove it).","title":"Step 4: Install Dev Requirements"},{"location":"tutorial/#step-5-create-a-github-repo","text":"Go to your GitHub account and create a new repo named mypackage , where mypackage matches the [project_slug] from your answers to running cookiecutter.
