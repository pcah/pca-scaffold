Also be noticed that there's pyproject.toml in this folder. This is the main configuration file of our project. Step 3: Install Poetry \u00b6 In this step we will install Poetry if you are not using it, since the whole project is managed by it. 1 pip install poetry In addition, Poetry provides a custom installer that will install poetry isolated from the rest of your system by vendorizing its dependencies. This is the recommended way of installing poetry. Step 4: Install Dev Requirements \u00b6 You should still be in the folder named as project_slug , which containing the pyproject.toml file. Install the new project's local development requirements with poetry install : 1 2 poetry install -E doc -E dev -E test poetry run tox Poetry will create its own virtualenv isolated from your system and install the dependencies in it. We installed extra dependency need by developer with -E {group} options, such as documentation build tools, lint, formatting and test tools etc. We also launch a smoke test here by running poetry run tox . This will run tox within created virtual environment, give you a test report and lint report. You should see no errors except some lint warnings. You can also activate the virtual environment manually with poetry shell , this will create a new shell. Tips Extra dependencies are grouped into three groups, doc, dev and test for better granularity. When you ship the package, dependencies in group doc, dev and test might not be shipped. As the developer, you will need install all the dependencies. Tips if you found erros like the following during tox run: 1 ERROR: InterpreterNotFound: python3.9 don't be panic, this is just because python3.x is not found on your machine. If you decide to support that version of Python in your package, please install it on your machine. Otherwise, remove it from tox.ini and pyproject.toml (search python3.x then remove it). Step 5: Create a GitHub Repo \u00b6 Go to your GitHub account and create a new repo named my-package , where my-package matches the project_slug from your answers to running cookiecutter. Then go to repo > settings > secrets, click on 'New repository secret', add the following secrets: TEST_PYPI_API_TOKEN, see How to apply TestPyPI token PYPI_API_TOKEN, see How to apply pypi token PERSONAL_TOKEN, see How to apply personal token Step 6: Set Up codecov integration \u00b6 Tips If you have already setup codecov integration and configured access for all your repositories, you can skip this step. In your browser, visit install codecov app , you'll be landed at this page: Click on the green install button at top right, choose all repositories then click on install button, following directions until all set. If the repo you created is a private repo, you need to set the following additional secrets, which is not required for public repos: CODECOV_TOKEN, see Codecov GitHub Action \u2014 Usage Step 7: Upload code to GitHub \u00b6 Back to your develop environment, find the folder named after the project_slug . Move into this folder, and then setup git to use your GitHub repo and upload the code: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 cd my-package git add . git commit -m \"Initial commit.\" git branch -M main git remote add origin git@github.com:myusername/my-package.git git push -u origin main Where myusername and my-package are adjusted for your username and repo name. You'll need a ssh key to push the repo. You can Generate a key or Add an existing one. Warning if you answered 'yes' to the question if install pre-commit hooks at last step, then you should find pre-commit be invoked when you run git commit , and some files may be modified by hooks. If so, please add these files and commit again . Check result \u00b6 After pushing your code to GitHub, go to GitHub web page, navigate to your repo, then click on actions link, you should find screen like this: There should be some workflows running. After they finished, go to TestPyPI , check if a new artifact is published under the name project_slug . Step 8. Check documentation \u00b6 Documentation will be published and available at https://{your_github_account}.github.io/{your_repo } once: the commit is tagged, and the tag name is started with 'v' (lower case) build/testing executed by GitHub CI passed If you'd like to see what it's look like now, you could run the following command: 1 poetry run mkdocs serve This will run the builtin development server for you to preview. Step 9. Make official release \u00b6 After done with your phased development in a feature branch, make a pull request, following instructions at release checklist , trigger first official release and check result at PyPI .","title":"Tutorial"},{"location":"tutorial/#tutorial","text":"Note Did you find this article confusing?
